Medicine Pills Tracker
Post featuring my recent work, CareZone♥️, the Medicine Pills tracker App. 🤗
This App will make sure that you never forget to take pills💊. All you need to do is fill in your pills in the App and it will automatically set a reminder for you.

Furthermore you will receive notification for each added pill from the App. 📌
Features:
1. Add or delete multiple medical pills to set reminder.
2. Notification Reminder for every medicine.
3. Options available like taking pills, before, after or in mid of a meal.
4. No need to open the App, the pills reminder will works even if the App is closed.
